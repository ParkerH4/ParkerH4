# Parker Hewitt

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Parker, a passionate developer! I hold a 2-year Software Development diploma from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Lethbridge. 

I have a strong foundation in Java, which I primarily learned during my time at SAIT. My skills also include HTML/CSS, SQL, JavaScript, Python, React, and Ruby on Rails. 

I'm always passionate about enhancing my skillset and continuously learning new technologies to stay up-to-date with industry trends.
